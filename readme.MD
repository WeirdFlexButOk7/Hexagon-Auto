# Hexagon Auto

An attempt in automating the infamous [Hexagon](https://distractionware.com/blog/2012/02/hexagon/) game, the prototype version of [Super Hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Hexagon), by [Terry Canvanagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Cavanagh_(developer)) using Python OpenCV.

Will make it better to run without any deaths soon hopefully.

The game can be found in [Flashpoint](https://flashpointarchive.org/) Archives.
